// In Material-UI, theme.breakpoints.down('md') is a way to define a media query that targets screen sizes below a certain threshold.

// Here's what's happening:

// - theme.breakpoints: This is an object that contains various breakpoint values defined by Material-UI. Breakpoints are essentially screen size thresholds that determine when to apply different styles or layouts.
// - down('md'): This method returns a media query string that targets screen sizes below the md breakpoint.

// So, what is md?

// In Material-UI, md is a shorthand for "medium". It corresponds to a screen size of 960px or wider. When you use theme.breakpoints.down('md'), you're creating a media query that targets screen sizes below 960px.

// Here are the default breakpoint values in Material-UI:

// - xs: 0px
// - sm: 600px
// - md: 960px
// - lg: 1280px
// - xl: 1920px

// When you use useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.down('md')), you're essentially asking Material-UI to return true when the screen size is below 960px, and false otherwise. This allows you to conditionally apply styles or hide/show components based on the screen size.
