// Material ui is the same as normal css just provides extra templates and has different tag names for the tags.

// <div> tag is replaced by <box> and <style> tag is replaced by <sx> 

// A Dropdown list in html used <select> and <option> tags. In material we use

// Box: The Box component serves as a wrapper component

// Stack: Stack is like a flex container.
